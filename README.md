# GNNPaper
GNN Graph theory paper for patent citation and network link prediction.
Final Project for the Gatech Deep Learning class.
We applied various graph network embedding technique including node2vec, SDNE, BigGraph, and the Graph Neutral Network technique such as the Graph Attention Network. Implementation can be requested.
